 * Revision History
 *
 * Version 1.0 based on a C++ package by April O'Neill, David Cowden,
 *     Dilan Ustek, Erik Opavsky, and Henry M. Walker
 *
 * Developers of the C package for Linux:
 *  Creators Version 2.0 (C functions for utilities,general,sensors,movement):
 *    Spencer Liberto
 *    Dilan Ustek
 *    Jordan Yuan
 *    Henry M. Walker
 *  Contributors Version 2.2-2.3: (C functions for image processing)
 *    Anita DeWitt
 *    Jason Liu
 *    Nick Knoebber
 *    Vasilisa Bashlovkina
 * Revision for Version 2.4:  (image row/column made to match matrix notation)
 *    Henry M. Walker
 *
 * Revisions for Version 3.0 
 *    Henry M. Walker
 *
 *  C ported to Macintosh
 *     Linux/Mac differences required for connections â€” otherwise same code
 *  OpenGL used to display images, replacing ImageMagick
 *     same [new] code used for both Linux and Macintosh
 *     1 process for robot control
 *     1 process needed for each titled window (not each image, as in 2.2-2.4)
 *  Blocking options (negative duration parameter)
 *     utilize separate thread timer
 *  MyroC implementation files organized by user function as follows:
 *
 * Revisions for Version 3.1 
 *    Henry M. Walker
 *
 *    Picture struct and image functions revised to allow 
 *       192 by  256 images from origial Fluke camera
 *       266 x 427 low-resolution images from Fluke 2
 *         (high-resolution (800 x 1280) too large for more than 2-4 
 *          variables on run-time stack)
 *       storage, retrieval, and display of any images up to 266 x 427 
 *
 * Revisions for Version 3.2
 *    Henry M. Walker
 *    
 *    Practical range of rBeep duration identified as <= 3.0014 seconds
 *    Image display and processing resolves several matters and adds functionality
 *        function rDisplayPicture completely rewritten
 *                over time OpenGL rountines had encountered troubles
 *                on Linux, specifically glutHideWindow() hid images, but could not be
 *                          restored, with difficulties depending on the graphics card
 *                on Mac, High Sierra generated compile warnings and 
 *                          restricted threads that could display images
 *    function rDisplayImageProcessingErrors added
 *    function rWaitTimedImageDisplay updated substantially

 * @note    high-resolution images (e.g., 800 by 1280) are not practical,

/* Procedures in this section, except rMotors, include a "time" parameter.
 *
 * Throughout, "time" is interpreted as follows:
 *     if time > 0, the call to the procedure is "blocking:
 *            That is, a call to the procedure starts a motion, and
 *            all other processing stops for the specified time (in seconds).
 *            After the specified time interval, the motion stops,
 *            and processing in the main program continues.             \n
 *     If time == 0, the procedure is "non-blocking":
 *            That is, the procedure starts a motion, 
 *            and that motion continues until another motion command is issued.
 *            Once the motion starts, other processing in the main
 *            program continues.                                        \n
 *     If time < 0, the procedure is "non-blocking": 
 *            That is, a call to the procedure starts a motion,
 *            and a timer is started for the abs("time").               \n
 *            Once the time interval is completed,                      \n
 *               if no other motion command has been issued,
 *                  a command to stop robot motion is given             \n
 *               if another motion command has been issued (before the
 *                  specified time), the new command is executed immediately,
 *                  and the timer is ignored.                           \n
 *           For example, suppose rForward is called with a time of -5 seconds:
 *               subsequent processing in the main program continues    \n
 *               if numerous beeps are issued or the camera is used or
 *                  a series of non-motion commands are issued, then
 *                  the rForward action stops in 5 seconds.             \n
 *               if an rRightTurn command is issued after 2 seconds,
 *                  then the rForward command is overridden by rRightTurn
 *                  and the timer for rForward (after another 3 seconds)
 *                  is ignored.
 *
 * Program termination with timed, non-blocking commands:
 *    When a non-blocking time is specified (i.e., time < 0), processing within 
 *    the controlling program continues.  However, the robot's Bluetooth connection
 *    (established with rConnect) is not severed until the non-blocking timer has
 *    expired and the motion stopped.  In particular, rDisconnect blocks until
 *    the specified non-blocking time is completed and the program tells the
 *    robot to stop.

 *
 * @warning The Picture struct is defined to be sufficiently large
 *          to store several low-resolution camera images (340756 bytes each)
 *             Experimentally, an array of up to 94 (not 95) Pictures is allowed
 *             However, the display of images requires that image data
 *                be copied, so display of many images may not work
 *          If a program hangs when working with Picture variables,
 *             the issue may involve lack of space on the runtime stack.
 *             To utilize a modest number of Pictures,   
 *             use "ulimit -s"  command, as needed, in a terminal window
 *             For example, ulimit -s 32768
 *             Sizes above 32768 may not be allowed in Linux or Mac OS X
